# UFO Sightings Database Project

This project came as a result of not finding a single source of updated data as regards UFO sightings aside from the one shared by <NUFORC> which is quite tedious to work with.

As at the time of commencing with this project, the following are the values of UFO Sightings by [shape](https://nuforc.org/webreports/ndxshape.html)

After exploring numerous dashbaords of the UFO projects [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/search/vizzes/ufo%20sightings), we decided to drop the duration column from the data source.
